#### About me:

I develop games and apps as a hobby.

I primarily work on Roblox, having the most experience in the Luau Programming Language. I design games, UI/UX, and more.
On Roblox, I've worked for a 11k member SCPF group and currently work on various independent projects as well as for a 55k member roleplaying group.

Outside of Roblox, I create Rust and JavaScript Applications & Games, 3D Model, and do Graphic Design. Though not as good as my knowledge in Luau, I do know the JavaScript Programming Language and am currently learning the Rust Programming Language. I primarily use these languages to create applications on Discord and Rust to build games as an hobby.
