## About me

Full time student, working on my degree. Developing on Roblox, Open Source, and Personal Projects in my free time.

I have the most experience in programming, particularly in Luau, Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript, and learning more. On Roblox, I've worked for games with over a million visits, as well as contributing to large groups and communities.

I enjoy working on my own games both on Roblox and in the Bevy Game Engine with the Rust Programming Language, as well as developing other applications (mostly with Rust as my choice of preference), and contributing to open source which is something I'm very passionate about.

When working on games, I take part in all areas of design. I enjoy 3D Modeling, Game Design, Graphic Design, and more. I also enjoy working with others on their projects and helping them to learn and improve their own talents.

## My Projects

### [YetAnotherNet](https://github.com/YetAnotherClown/YetAnotherNet)

A Data-Driven Networking Library, opposed to traditional Event-Driven Networking Libraries found on Roblox. It's been designed to work well with ECS, and other data-oriented code.

### Mojave Wastes

A Fallout inspired RPG set in the Mojave Desert, featuring player-led in-game factions with base building, exploration, and more. This game is currently in development, no release date is currently set.

### [Blood's S.C.P. Foundation](https://www.roblox.com/groups/5680845/SCP-SECURE-CONTAIN-PROTECT)

As Head of Development for the group, I've been tasked with developing a successor to the previous group facility. 

It's primarily a role-playing game, featuring combat and anamolous entities called "SCPs." Members of the foundation are tasked with studying and containing these entities, while death row inmates tasked as being lab rats and other infamous groups such as the Chaos Insurgency attempt to sow the destruction of the foundation.

### Roblox Ranking Bot

A Web Server, written in Rust, capable of handling requests to rank users on Roblox in groups, as well as client code to send those requests. This project isn't public, but is being used in a few groups of mine as well as other large groups which have paid to use it.

### Other Projects

I'm also developing some more open-source libraries, as well as assisting on a few other projects not listed here. This list is not exhaustive, but highlights my primary goals and focuses.
